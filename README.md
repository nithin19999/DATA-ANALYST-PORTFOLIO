I am a skilled data analyst with experience in data manipulation, code optimization, and project documentation. With a strong background in SQL, Python, and PowerBI, I have demonstrated my ability to analyze complex datasets and provide actionable insights through comprehensive reports and interactive dashboards. I aspire to work in data analyst and business analyst roles.

EDUCATION AND TRAININGS 


I hold a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from BNM Institute of Technology in Bangalore, graduating with First Class Distinction. Additionally, I completed my pre-university education focusing on Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Science. Currently, I am enrolled in an ongoing Data Science and AI course from Learnbay to further enhance my expertise in these fields.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE																									

As an Associate Analyst at Cognizant Technology Solutions from October 2023 to March 2024, I utilized SQL for data manipulation, ensuring smooth workflow functionality. I gathered and implemented client requirements for code standards and change requests, optimized the existing code base, performed code remediation, and standardized code across various regions. My exceptional collaboration skills and consistent performance earned me recognition from project managers.

Prior to this role, I worked as a Programmer Analyst at Cognizant from September 2021 to September 2023. I was responsible for code maintenance in the Library Server using Savigent, conducting code merges, optimizing code, performing unit testing, and maintaining project documentation. As an intern at Cognizant from January 2021 to May 2021, I completed intensive training in advanced technologies such as C-Sharp, SQL, HTML, and CSS.

PROJECTS

 The COVID-19 Data Analysis Project involved using Python (Pandas, NumPy) for comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 datasets, and developing interactive dashboards with PowerBI to identify trends and patterns.

Additionally, during the Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage in April 2024, I served as a Data Analyst, providing insights into content trends for a hypothetical social media client. My work involved analyzing multiple datasets, preparing presentations, and effectively communicating key insights to stakeholders. Another significant project involved reducing downtime in the assembly line at Hitachi Astemo FIE Pvt Ltd, where I utilized data-driven approaches to identify inefficiencies and implement strategic adjustments.

Technical and Soft Skills
I possess strong technical skills in Python, MS Excel, SQL, PowerBI, data analytics, and data visualization. My soft skills include effective communication, collaboration, time management, adaptability, and presentation abilities, making me a well-rounded professional capable of handling diverse challenges in the field of data analysis.
